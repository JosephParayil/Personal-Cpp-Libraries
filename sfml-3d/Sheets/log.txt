Next step: Implement depth-sorting


New class: Object3D_Collection
    objects = Vector of pairs: < ID , Object3D >
    
    function: depthSort() - sorts everything based on distance to camera

Ordering of the vector determines closness (sorted farthest to closest)



ON depth sorting:
- In it's current stage, it is not perfect
- Future modifications:
    - Implement just a 1-step bubble sorting step each frame for improved performance
    - In this way, we can resolve lines and balls to true precision.

Transitioning everything to OOP seems to be a success.

Next steps:
    1. Split into a 2D and 3D file
    2. Make it compatible with older versions of code
    3. Test with previous versions that used 3D engine
----4. Handle cubes and just change older versions that drew cubes

5. Implement depth-sorting
