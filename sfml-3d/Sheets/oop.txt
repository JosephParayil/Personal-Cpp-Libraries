Consider this code:


I want to revolutionize the structure of this 3D rendering code using OOP.


First of all, I want to define objects for 3D and 2D structures. 


Object3D
    Static Methods/Members:
        - convert_3d_to_2d
	Members:
		- vec4 position
	
	Methods:
		- computeShape (abstract method)
		- draw
			- internally calls computeShape and calls the shapes' draw function
		

	Subclasses: 
		- Line3D
			Members:
				- vec4 a
                - vec4 b

            Methods:
                - computeShape returns the corresponding Line2D
                - draw can pass in thickness as a parameter
		
		- Sphere3D
            Members:
                - float radius
            
            Methods:
                - computeShape returns a Circle2D

        - Cube3D: a bit of an oddball, doesn't quite logically fit in with the other two subclasses
        - Will possibly make it a class separate from Object3D. It is more of a collection of Object3D objects.
            Members:
                - It will have a collection of 12 Line3D objects
            Methods:
                - draw would just draw each line3D objects

Shape2D
    Static methods/members:
        - normalize_point
	Members:

	Methods:
         - draw (abstract) (takes in color, window, etc)
         - computeCollisionWithPoint (abstract)
	Subclasses:
		- Line2D
            - Two sf::Vector2f points

		- Circle2D
            - One sf::Vector2f point and a float radius
	




Notes: 
	- I want to only use structs as I do not intend on any members being private.
	- vec4 is a essentially a 3D point with homogenous coordinates.
    - NEAR and FOV will be moved to being part of the Camera class imported in 3d_camera.hpp
